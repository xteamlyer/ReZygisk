         A bind mount has neither problem. The overlay is replaced rather than
         detached, so nothing of it survives to be read back, and the paths
         underneath keep resolving because they are backed by the very same
         filesystem the process was already using.

         subdirectories of it. A plain bind replaces the mount point without
