# INFO: The Rust half of VexZygisk (rust/vexcore): the ELF symbol lookups and
#       the Zn module line parser. Built by cargo rather than by the compiler
#       these Makefiles drive, because cargo is what knows how to produce a
#       `no_std` staticlib for an Android target - and it is the same command a
#       developer runs by hand, so there is one way to build it and one place it
#       can be configured.
#
#       It is defined here rather than in either component's Makefile because
#       both link it: the loader and the tracer read ELF files the same way, and
#       the daemon parses the same module lines the loader's modules ship. One
#       archive, built once per build type, under this build's object directory.
#
#       The linker variable is named for cargo's benefit even though a staticlib
#       is assembled and never linked: a dependency that grows a link step later
#       should not fail with a message about a compiler nobody set up.
#
#       The copy at the end writes a temporary and renames it, and that is not
#       tidiness. The loader and the daemon are two sub-makes that the top-level
#       make runs side by side, both need this one archive, and both therefore
#       build it - cargo takes its own lock on the target directory, but the copy
#       that follows it is two cp processes writing one file, and a link that
#       arrives in the middle reads a half-written archive:
#
#         ld.lld: error: ... Archive::children failed: truncated or malformed
#         archive (offset to next archive member past the end of the archive)
#
#       A rename within a directory is atomic, so a reader gets either the
#       previous archive or the new one and never a mixture.
#
#       The temporary carries the shell's pid, and both commands share one line
#       because they have to share one shell:
#
#         - make turns a pair of dollars into one, and it is the shell that turns
#           the pair it receives into a number, so the pid is written as four
#           dollars. Two of them reach the shell as one, which is not a pid and
#           not even an expansion, and the two sub-makes then agree on the same
#           name again - the same collision, one level down.
#         - and make runs each line of a recipe in its own shell, so a cp and an
#           mv on separate lines are two different pids and the mv looks for a
#           file the cp never made. On one line they are one shell, one
#           expansion, one name.
#
#       Two sub-makes, two pids, two temporaries, and one rename that wins.
