/* INFO: Host-side tests for the ELF reader.

   The loader only ever runs on a device, where a failure shows up as a module
   that silently does not load. These tests run the same code on the build host
   so a broken parse fails the build instead.

   Two inputs are used:

     - a synthetic ELF whose symbol table exists only inside a compressed
       .gnu_debugdata section, which is what a stripped system library looks
       like. Every symbol found in it comes through the mini-debug path.
     - the test binary itself, a genuine compiler output with real hash
       tables, so the ordinary lookups are covered too. */
