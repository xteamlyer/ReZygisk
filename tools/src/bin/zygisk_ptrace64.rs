//! The `zygisk-ptrace64` command line front end.
//!
//! This is the Rust replacement for `loader/src/ptracer/main.c`. It owns
//! argument parsing, the banner, and the usage text; everything a subcommand
//! actually *does* still lives in the C engine next to it (`init_monitor`,
//! `trace_zygote`, `send_control_command`, `rezygiskd_get_info`), which is
//! linked into the same shared object. The split is deliberate: the engine is
//! ptrace, /proc parsing and socket code that has nothing to do with a CLI, and
//! moving it is a different job with a different risk.
//!
//! What this file does own is the part that was easy to get wrong in C: the
//! subcommand grammar. `trace` took a pid that had to be validated *before*
//! reaching `kill()`, because a parse that yields 0 signals the whole process
//! group.
