//! The Rust half of VexZygisk's loader.
//!
//! Nothing here owns a device resource, calls into ART, or knows what a
//! zygote is. What lives in this crate is the part of the loader that reads
//! bytes an untrusted file supplied and decides what they mean - the ELF
//! symbol lookups today - and the point of moving that half is that the C
//! version had to say "and if this offset is past the end, give up" at every
//! step, by hand, in a function that also had to remember to free what it
//! allocated on the way out. Slices and `Option` say both of those once.
//!
//! The C side keeps what is genuinely its own: mapping the file, reading the
//! process maps to find the load base, and decompressing `.gnu_debugdata`
//! through the xz decoder it already links. This crate is handed the tables
//! that come out of that and answers one question - which address does this
//! symbol name have - through the same ABI the C functions had, so no caller
//! changes.
